# comment - any line starting with # is a comment and shell will ignore those lines

#1.How to write shell scripts file

# File ending with .sh is what we prefer to make a shell script so we understand that is a shell script .But for os if does not matters

# How to run a shell script
# bash script.sh

#2. Printing

# echo word
# word will be printed on screen by echo command
# echo we can print colours
## echo.sh is already having those

# we can print multiple lines in wcho command
# echo -e "Line1\Line2\n\nLine3"

# we can print a tab space between words
echo -e "world1\t\tworld2

#3. Variables

# Declare a variable
a=10

# Acess a variable , using echo command to print data in a variable
echo a - $a

# command substution
DATE=$(date)
echo Date - $DATE

#Arithmetic substituion
Add=$((2+3))
echo Add of 2+3 -$ADD

# Properties of a variable

# Red write
b=10
b=20

## b was declared with 10 value and again b was declared with 20 value
echo b -$b

# we will se 20, because the property read-write will allow to overwrite the value 10 in b with 20

# Some times in case if we need to mark  a variable as readonly after declaring then a readonly command will help
readonly b
b=30

# local variable
# variable declared in this script can be acess within that script because the default property is local
# Variable declared in cli in shell cannot be accessed in script

echo c - $c
