# comment - any line starting with # is a comment and shell will ignore those lines

#1.How to write shell scripts file

# File ending with .sh is what we prefer to make a shell script so we understand that is a shell script .But for os if does not matters

# How to run a shell script
# bash script.sh

#2. Printing

# echo word
# word will be printed on screen by echo command
# echo we can print colours
## echo.sh is already having those

# we can print multiple lines in wcho command
# echo -e "Line1\Line2\n\nLine3"

# we can print a tab space between words
echo -e "world1\t\tworld2"

#3. Variables

# Declare a variable
a=10

# Acess a variable , using echo command to print data in a variable
echo a - $a

# command substution
DATE=$(date)
echo Date - $DATE

#Arithmetic substituion
Add=$((2+3))
echo Add of 2+3 -$ADD

# Properties of a variable

# Red write
b=10
b=20

## b was declared with 10 value and again b was declared with 20 value
echo b -$b

# we will se 20, because the property read-write will allow to overwrite the value 10 in b with 20

# Some times in case if we need to mark  a variable as readonly after declaring then a readonly command will help
readonly b
b=30

# local variable
# variable declared in this script can be acess within that script because the default property is local
# Variable declared in cli in shell cannot be accessed in script

echo c - $c

# export c -This will mark the variable as environment variable so all the scripts /commands that executed on terminal can access this script
#           If we declare environment variable inside scripts ,all the scripts /commands that executs inside this scripts can access that variables

#4. Inputs

# Special variables
# $0 - script name
# $0 - First Argument
# $0 - Second Argument
# $0 - All Argument
# $0 - No of Argument

 # Scripts has its own inputs, function also have their own inputs

#5. Condition

 # If Condition
 # If conditions types/forms
   # 1. Simple IF
   # 2. If Else
   # 3. Else - IF

   # If uses expressions
     # 1. String expression
     # 2. Number expressions
     # 3. File expressions

# Case condition
   # This can do only string comparisions,hence it is not a much preferred option.

#6.Loop

# If we wnat execute same commands again and again continously then loop will help you. there are two criterias Expression based and input based

# Two Loop command
  # Expression Based loop
  # Expression based Loop - while
  # Input Based loop -for

#7. Function
  # If we declare a name to set of commands then it is called as function.
  # Variable inside main program can be accessed and modified function and vicevers.
  # Function has its own exit status ranges 0-255 same like exit command.

#8. Exit Status
  # Exit command ranges from 0.255

#9. Quotes
    # why quotes ?
      # If there is one special character in input to the common then we use quotes.
# we have single quotes and double quotes.
          # single quotes - To print as it is we use single quotes
          # Double Quotes - To print along with variable substution.
#10. Redirectors


# input (<) and output (>) redirectors
# output is two types
  # output - 1> or >
  # error - 2>
    # OUTPUT + ERROR - &>
  # Append - >>
